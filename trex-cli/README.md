# Trex Agent

Standalone Rust API coding agent for named DeepSeek, MiniMax, OpenRouter, and
custom OpenAI-compatible profiles. It is independent of the desktop app.

Build and test from the repository root:

```powershell
cargo build --locked --release --manifest-path trex-cli/Cargo.toml
cargo test --locked --manifest-path trex-cli/Cargo.toml
```

Save a profile using JSON on stdin (`apiKey` may be included there, never in
command arguments). Example without a key:

```powershell
'{"name":"TREX1","provider":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-v4-pro"}' | .\trex-cli\target\release\trex-agent.exe profiles save --stdin-json
.\trex-cli\target\release\trex-agent.exe profiles list --json
.\trex-cli\target\release\trex-agent.exe --profile TREX1 chat --mode ask
```

Use `TREX_HOME` to isolate configuration, encrypted credentials, and conversation
history. Real providers require a stored key; only loopback mock servers can run
without one. Windows uses DPAPI, macOS Keychain, Linux persistent Secret Service.
Unavailable secure storage is an error.

Keys are absent from profile metadata, launcher arguments, and command output.
Windows credentials are encrypted with user-scoped DPAPI; the CLI restricts new
storage to the current user. Existing shared homes or profile files are rejected
without changing permissions on an unrelated user-selected directory. Symbolic
links, junctions, and hard-linked storage files are rejected as well. Changing a
provider or endpoint requires explicitly replacing or deleting its key.

Use a dedicated private directory for `TREX_HOME`, not a shared project folder.
These protections do not defend against a compromised OS account or administrator,
and permission checks do not provide an OS sandbox against hostile parent-path
changes. Never paste credentials into chat or project files; recognizable secrets
are removed from handoff packages, but redaction cannot identify every secret.

Ask mode prompts before each write or shell command. Plan is enforced read-only;
full allows autonomous mutations and unrestricted shell. Interactive commands:
`/history`, `/recover`, `/exit`. Ctrl+C interrupts a running turn. Resume with
`chat --conversation UUID`; discover conversations with `sessions list --json`.

Desktop integrations launch `trex-agent --profile NAME app-server`. See
[PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) for the complete version 1 JSON-RPC wire contract,
image/inbox receipts, profile management, recovery, and tool boundaries.

All tests use temporary workspaces and loopback mock providers. No real API key
or paid completion is needed. Windows binary and offline transport behavior are
tested here; Linux/macOS secure-storage runtime behavior requires their native
OS services and has not been exercised on Windows.
